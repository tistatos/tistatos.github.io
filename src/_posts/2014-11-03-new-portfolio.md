---

It's been a while, but now I've finally taken the time to fix my new portfolio. Most of the stuff you'll find here at the moment are projects I've worked on during my education or at hackathons.

The idea is to try, for the fifth time, to start blogging more about my projects and general developing. You can find my old blog here: [Developing under influence](http://devunderinfluence.blogspot.se/).
A blog I had with one of my great friends, [Fredrik Lindner](http://www.internetchefen.se)

2014 has so far been quite awesome I must say. One of my projects, Mote.fm, Won two awards at **C-awards**. Then in september, I participated in a hackathon called **East Sweden Hack** and my team won a trip to silicon valley!
