#Hello!
My Name is Erik Sandrén. My passion lies in real-time computer graphics and Motion capture never turn down any programming challenges that comes my way.
This page consists of some of the project's I've worked on as well as my CV and my blog.

I'm currently studying M. Sc in Media Technology & Engineering at Linköpings University, Sweden. I'm also part of a student project called LiTHehack, a project to help other students with programming.
Before i started my M. Sc, I worked within the game industry as a Technical Artist and worked on a few games.

If you want to see want I'm currently working on, Github is the place to go!
