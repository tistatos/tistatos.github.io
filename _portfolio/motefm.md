**Democratize music**

*Mote.fm won 2 awards at [C-Awards 2014](http://www.cawards.se)*

Mote.fm is a way to democratize the play queue of spotify at parties. It lets everyone at the party suggest what song should be played and also allows everyone at the party to up-vote a certain song if they want to hear it sooner. No more battling over spotify. No more thieving in the play queue. No more worries someone will tinker with your computer when they use spotify.
