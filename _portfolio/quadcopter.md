# Quadproject
A project made in the course modelling and simulation. The assigment was to take
a real life system and create a mathematical model of that system and then
visually simulate it using a numerical method.

We made a quadcopter, by measuring the height and angles of the body, we could do
some stabilization of the quadcopter. It's somewhat unstable still though.

One day, we will also replace the model for something cooler :)
