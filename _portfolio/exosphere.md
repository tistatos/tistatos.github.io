#Exosphere

Exosphere is a puzzle game in which you spawn satellites and manipulate their
orbits to achieve goals. The plan was to have specific goals with a optimal
solution in terms of number of satellites and time. In your arsenal you can
change: the semi-major axis, inclination and eccentricity of the orbits.
And in the vertical Slice the goals are quite simple and are not measured in
terms of number of satellites or time.
