# Mink

With financial support from our University and the Department of Computer and Information Science, We're granted to develop our own idea for an Android app that involves Math and Optical Character Recognition(OCR). The result of this Project was Mink.
The idea for mink is to simplify the input of complex mathematical equations onto tablets and smartphones in a natural way.

The user has the ability to write equations directly on the devices surface and mink will translate the input into MathML and TeX via VisionObjects MyScript Webservices. That then can be sent to services like WolframAlpha. If you have a smaller device, there is an option to instead take a picture of an equation written on paper. Once mink has parsed the image, the user can freely modify the equation to add or remove elements.
