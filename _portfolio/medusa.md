# Medusa
Medusa was my Bachelor Thesis in Media technology and engineering.
with the help of kinects, a person could be scanned within a few seconds and
then recreated in 3D with help of reconstruction algorithms.

The project used PCL (Point Cloud Library), freenect, OpenCV and many other
libraries to achieve this.

The project was made by me and 6 more people under one semeseter

The result was a scalable system in regards of kinects but with some issues
to scan the back of the user. Read more about the result in my blog posts.
