# Stereoscopic Snow Simulation (SSS)
A simulation of falling snow made to be shown in stereoscopic 3D in dome theaters, for instance at [Visualiseringscentret C](http://visualiseringscenter.se/) in Norrk√∂ping. The snow simulation is written in OpenGL/C++ with the SGCT library (simple cluster graphics toolkit). The project was made as a part of the 3D computer graphics course, TNM061.
