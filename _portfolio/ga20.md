# Gå 2.0
*Won prize at [East Sweden Hack 2014](http://eastswedenhack.se/tavlingsbidrag-2014)*


GÅ 2.0 is an intuitive and social webbased app. The goal of the app is to motivate the youth to walk more and also help the local businesses. By walking to designated positions the user gains points. With enough points collected, the user can unlock **Wins**. Wins are discounts or offers at certain stores and restaurants. By not only competing for discounts, the user can also compete together with its school class to collect enough points to unlock a special price for the whole class. With the power of social media, the app can help motivate your friends to join you in collecting points.
