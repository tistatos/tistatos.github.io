# Hello!
My Name is Erik Sandr√©n. My passion lies in graphics rendering (realtime and offline). I never turn down any programming challenges that comes my way.
This page consists of some of the project's I've worked on while at university and spare time as well as my CV.

If you want to see want I'm currently working on, Github is the place to go!
